# SFND 2D Feature Tracking

<img src="images/keypoints.png" width="820" height="248" />

The idea of the camera course is to build a collision detection system - that's the overall goal for the Final Project. As a preparation for this, we have to build the feature tracking part and test various detector / descriptor combinations to see which ones perform best. This mid-term project consists of four parts:

* First, focus on loading images, setting up data structures and putting everything into a ring buffer to optimize memory load. 
* Then, integrate several keypoint detectors such as HARRIS, FAST, BRISK and SIFT and compare them with regard to number of keypoints and speed. 
* In the next part, focus on descriptor extraction and matching using brute force and also the FLANN approach we discussed in the previous lesson. 
* In the last part, once the code framework is complete, test the various algorithms in different combinations and compare them with regard to some performance measures. 

## Tasks Accomplished

### Task MP.1 Data Buffer Optimization
Implemented ring buffer in which new elements are added to tail end and older items are removed from head end.
It is accomplished using erase() method in vector library.

### Task MP.2 Keypoint Detection
Implemented HARRIS, FAST, BRISK, ORB, AKAZE and SIFT detectors with OpenCV library and made them selectable with a string.

### Task MP.3 Keypoint Removal
Removed keypoints except those on preceding vehicle by removing all keypoints detected outside a predefined reactangle (cv::Rect).

### Task MP.4 Keypoint Descriptors
Implemented BRIEF, ORB, FREAK, AKAZE and SIFT descriptors with OpenCV library and made them selectable with a string.

### Task MP.5 Descriptor Matching
Implemented FLANN matching as well as k-nearest neighbor selection and made them selectable with a string.

### Task MP.6 Descriptor Distance Ratio
Implemented Descriptor Distance Ratio test which looks at the ratio of best to second-best match to decide whether to keep an associated keypoint pair.
Ratio used as 0.8.

### Task MP.7 Performance Evaluation 1
Counted the number of keypoints on the preceding vehicle for all 10 images for all the detectors implemented and analyzed their neighborhood size.
